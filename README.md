This repository contains all the main code segments that I have used to construct the results within my dissertation.
This includes the bulk generators that I created to generate the initial acceptance plots and the individual Breit-Wigner distributions; alongside the other plots in the document, such as the weighting and ds width plots.
Each of the code segments have each been commented with general information that helps to understand how the code works and what the purpose of each segment is.
